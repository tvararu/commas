Goddamn commas
===

At one point in 2013 I got frustrated over the amount of people that I found on Facebook that just couldn't get their commas correct. So I built a small website that I could link to in order to express my opinionated viewpoint on this touching subject.

This is a compiled source code repository, and was generated with [roots](http://roots.cx/). I no longer have the original source, and I'm just piggybacking on Github Pages for free static site hosting.
